# SOS-Celestial-Mechanics

Welcome, This is Ashwin Goyal. A CSE freshie from IITB and this is my
SOS report as a part of the Summer of Science project on celestial mechanics.
I would like to thank my mentor Ammar Barbhaiwala and the MnP club for
giving me the opportunity to undertake this project.
I have taken a textbook type of approach and have prepared a concise
report explaining all the concepts I have learnt and understood. The re-
sults and concepts are explained but a majority of the derivations have been
skipped, in interest of time and conciseness. Anyone interested in the deriva-
tions and complete mathematical analysis with problems may refer to the
material I have used for my project.
The following is the reference material which I have used to study these
concept:
1. Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students by Howard Curtis
2. Introduction to Space Dynamics by William Tyrrel Thomson
3. Introduction to Space Flight by Francis J. Hale
The images(except the screenshots from Spyder) in the report have been
taken from the first book, Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students by
Howard Curtis
